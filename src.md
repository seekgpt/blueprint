**SeekGPT Request for Comment (SRC)**

SeekGPT Request for Comment (SRC) Process

**1. Introduction**

The SeekGPT Request for Comment (SRC) process is designed to facilitate the incorporation of significant research findings and valuable contributions into the SeekGPT models. It serves as a formal mechanism for researchers to propose and document impactful advancements that can enhance the capabilities and scope of SeekGPT.

**2. Purpose**



* To provide a structured platform for researchers to propose significant research findings.
* To ensure that valuable contributions are thoroughly evaluated and considered for inclusion in SeekGPT models.
* To foster transparency and collaboration in the development of SeekGPT.
* To maintain a record of research advancements that have influenced SeekGPT.

**3. Scope**

The SRC process is applicable to research findings that:



* Significantly improve the performance, efficiency, or capabilities of SeekGPT models.
* Introduce novel algorithms, architectures, or techniques relevant to SeekGPT.
* Address critical challenges or limitations in existing SeekGPT models.
* Contribute to the ethical and responsible development of AI.
* Expand the multilingual capabilities of SeekGPT.
* Provide significant new data, or methods of data curation.

**4. SRC Process**



* **Proposal Submission:**
    * Researchers submit a detailed SRC document outlining their research findings, methodology, and proposed impact on SeekGPT.
    * The SRC document should adhere to a predefined template (see Section 6).
    * Submissions are made through the SeekGPT GitHub repository or a designated online platform.
* **Initial Review:**
    * The SeekGPT core team conducts an initial review to ensure the SRC document is complete and meets the scope criteria.
    * Incomplete or out-of-scope SRCs may be rejected or returned for revision.
* **Public Comment Period:**
    * Accepted SRCs are made publicly available for review and comment by the SeekGPT community.
    * A designated period (e.g., 2-4 weeks) is provided for community members to provide feedback, ask questions, and suggest improvements.
    * The community discussions will take place on the relevant github issue, or forum post.
* **Technical Evaluation:**
    * The SeekGPT core team, along with relevant domain experts, conducts a technical evaluation of the SRC.
    * The evaluation considers the research methodology, experimental results, and potential impact on SeekGPT.
    * This may include red teaming, and other safety evaluations.
* **Decision and Implementation:**
    * Based on the technical evaluation and community feedback, the SeekGPT core team makes a decision on whether to accept or reject the SRC.
    * Accepted SRCs are prioritized for implementation into SeekGPT models.
    * The implementation process may involve collaboration between the original researchers and the SeekGPT development team.
    * The SRC is then added to the official documentation.
* **Documentation:**
    * Accepted SRCs are documented in the SeekGPT repository, including the research findings, implementation details, and impact on the model.

**5. SRC Document Template**



* **Title:** A concise and descriptive title.
* **Authors:** Names and affiliations of the researchers.
* **Abstract:** A brief summary of the research findings and their potential impact.
* **Introduction:** Background information and motivation for the research.
* **Methodology:** Detailed description of the research methodology, including data, algorithms, and experimental setup.
* **Results:** Presentation of experimental results and analysis.
* **Impact on SeekGPT:** Explanation of how the research findings can be incorporated into SeekGPT models and their potential benefits.
* **Ethical Considerations:** Discussion of any ethical implications of the research and proposed solutions.
* **References:** List of relevant publications and resources.

**6. Community Engagement**



* Encourage active participation in the public comment period.
* Provide constructive feedback and suggestions for improvement.
* Respect diverse opinions and perspectives.
