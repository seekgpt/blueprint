**SeekGPT Improvement Proposals (SIP)**

SeekGPT Improvement Proposals (SIP) Process

**1. Introduction**

The SeekGPT Improvement Proposals (SIP) process is a mechanism for proposing and discussing new features, enhancements, and changes to the SeekGPT models. It aims to foster community-driven innovation and ensure that SeekGPT evolves in a transparent and collaborative manner.

**2. Purpose**



* To provide a structured platform for proposing new ideas and improvements to SeekGPT.
* To allow researchers to plan out, and develop new features, that can then be turned into a SRC.
* To ensure that all proposals are thoroughly evaluated and considered.
* To promote community engagement and collaboration in the development of SeekGPT.
* To maintain a record of proposed improvements and their status.

**3. Scope**

The SIP process is applicable to proposals that:



* Introduce new features or functionalities to SeekGPT models.
* Improve the performance, efficiency, or usability of SeekGPT.
* Address bugs or limitations in existing SeekGPT models.
* Enhance the ethical and responsible development of AI.
* Expand the multilingual capabilities of SeekGPT.
* Improve the developer experience or documentation.

**4. SIP Process**



* **Proposal Submission:**
    * Researchers or community members submit a detailed SIP document outlining their proposal, motivation, and implementation plan.
    * The SIP document should adhere to a predefined template (see Section 5).
    * Submissions are made through the SeekGPT GitHub repository or a designated online platform.
* **Initial Review:**
    * The SeekGPT core team conducts an initial review to ensure the SIP document is complete and meets the scope criteria.
    * Incomplete or out-of-scope SIPs may be rejected or returned for revision.
* **Public Discussion:**
    * Accepted SIPs are made publicly available for discussion by the SeekGPT community.
    * A designated period (e.g., 1-2 weeks) is provided for community members to provide feedback, ask questions, and suggest improvements.
    * The community discussions will take place on the relevant github issue, or forum post.
* **Technical Evaluation:**
    * The SeekGPT core team, along with relevant domain experts, conducts a technical evaluation of the SIP.
    * The evaluation considers the feasibility, impact, and potential risks of the proposed changes.
* **Decision and Implementation:**
    * Based on the technical evaluation and community feedback, the SeekGPT core team makes a decision on whether to accept, reject, or defer the SIP.
    * Accepted SIPs are prioritized for implementation into SeekGPT models.
    * The implementation process may involve collaboration between the original proposer and the SeekGPT development team.
    * Accepted SIPs are then used as a base for SRC.
* **Documentation:**
    * Accepted SIPs are documented in the SeekGPT repository, including the proposal details, implementation status, and any relevant discussion.

**5. SIP Document Template**



* **Title:** A concise and descriptive title.
* **Authors:** Names and affiliations of the proposers.
* **Abstract:** A brief summary of the proposed improvement.
* **Motivation:** Explanation of the need for the proposed improvement.
* **Specification:** Detailed description of the proposed changes, including technical specifications and implementation details.
* **Rationale:** Explanation of the design choices and trade-offs.
* **Backward Compatibility:** Discussion of any potential impact on existing SeekGPT applications.
* **Security Considerations:** Discussion of any security implications of the proposed changes.
* **References:** List of relevant publications and resources.

**6. Community Engagement**



* Encourage active participation in the public discussion period.
* Provide constructive feedback and suggestions for improvement.
* Respect diverse opinions and perspectives.
